    Build NetworkX graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : Network|SubNetwork

    branch_components : [str]
        Components to use as branches. The default are
        passive_branch_components in the case of a SubNetwork and
        branch_components in the case of a Network.

    weight : str
        Branch attribute to use as weight

    inf_weight : bool|float
        How to treat infinite weights (default: False). True keeps the infinite
        weight. False skips edges with infinite weight. If a float is given it
        is used instead.
